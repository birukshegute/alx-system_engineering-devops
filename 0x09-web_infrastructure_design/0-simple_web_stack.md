## A Server:
A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

## The role of the domain name:
The role of the domain is to make the ip address of a server human readable. In our example, the IPV4 adress 8.8.8.8 may cause users a problem as it is a long number and it may be difficult to remember it (most IP adresses are like that). But, the doamain name foobar.com is easier to remember and therefore it will make the website accessible. A communication exchange between the user browser and a DNS server will translate the domain name into the respective IP adress using the DNS A record.

## What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com

It is a CNAME type DNS. 
A CNAME is a DNS record type that maps the subdomains or the alias names to the true Domain.

## The role of the web server

A web server is a computer system capable of delivering web content to end users over the internet via a web browser. The end user processes a request via a web browser installed on a web server. The communication between a web server or browser and the end user takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The primary role of a web server is to store, process, and deliver requested information or webpages to end users.
